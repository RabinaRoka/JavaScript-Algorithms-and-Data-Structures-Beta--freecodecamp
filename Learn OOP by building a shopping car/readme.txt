OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, developers use objects and classes to structure their code.

#The this keyword in JavaScript is used to refer to the current object. Depending on where this is used, what it references changes. In the case of a class, it refers to the instance of the object being constructed. You can use the this keyword to set the properties of the object being instantiated.
